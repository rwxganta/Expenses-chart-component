## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

AI got the opportunite to review my knowledge on flexbox and ::pseudo-elements as well as those HTML tags that I always forget. Still really trick to know how to structure the HTML, but I'm always learning :)


### Continued development

- I definitly need more HTML practice focus on code structure and proper tags usage
- There are some CSS properties like :nth-child that I have to put a little more effort
- Start my studies at dark modes / prefer-color-scheme
